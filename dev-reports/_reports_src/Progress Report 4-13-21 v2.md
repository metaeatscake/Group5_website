Progress Report, __April 13 2021__ *(8 hours after the first report)*

Site Completion: About __72%__

## Missing Features:

* Feed View Post
* Feed Comment
* User View Liked Posts
* Admin Controls (this is after 100%, doesn't count)

## Needs Further Work:

* Profile.php
* handleLogin.php
* General CSS stuff

## Would be nice to implement, but current way is fine:

* AJAX (either through jQuery or through pure Javascript, but pure JS is preferred)

-----
At this pace, probably going to mostly finish the site before the 20% passing...
